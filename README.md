# Fair warning...

I found the original source for this driver [on Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b3muqkezsdirmje/Agedate-AC1200-New%20Driver%203.22-LINUX.zip) linked by the seller on [an Amazon listing](https://amzn.to/2Js9AL2).  Don't you love how reputable these driver bundles are?  Nothing say "no one tampered with this after it left the OEM" like downloading from Dropbox / Baidu / etc.
